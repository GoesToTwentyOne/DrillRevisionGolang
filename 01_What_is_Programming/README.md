  - parts and review it.
  - Problem identification
  - System analysis
  - Fixed Programming language
  - Coding
  - Compilation
  - Maintenance etc.
- The languages  use a computer to solve  problems or write  software programs. These languages are called programming language. Like-GO, JAVA, PYTHON, C++ etc.
