# **CLI and GOlang workspace**

- [x] **What is CLI (Command Line Interface)?**
- A command line interface is a text-based user interface used to view and manage computer files. CLI provides a CMD where user typed their commands and set for systems. Command line interfaces are also called command-line user interfaces, console user interfaces and character user interfaces.
- **A CLI consists of 3 parts:-**
     - **1. CMD (Command Prompt):**
     CMD is the default command-line interpreter for the windows operating system. Its most powerful tools on a computer.
     - **2. Cursor:**
     This is a small horizontal line which is used for typing text or knowing change letters position. If the user wants to write or delete something it takes help cursor.
     - **3. Command:**
     A command is a set of text-based instructions which has certain value to the system.


- [x] **What is Environment variable?**
    - Variables that can be used across terminal commands are called environment variables.
    - %HOMEPATH% is an environment variable present in command line environments. It is used to get the path to the current user’s home directory. This makes it easy for programs to access the home directory when needed.
-   **Environment variable consists of 2 parts:-**
    - **1. System variables:**
    System environment variables are globally accessed by all users its means set for everyone.
    - **2. User Variables:**
    User environment variables are specific only to the currently logged-in user its means set for each user.

- [x] **What is File?**
    - A collection of data, programs etc stored in a computer’s memory(primary-volatile memory like RAM) or on a storage device(primary-non-volatile memory like Hard Drive) under a certain identifying name. Just as words can be written to paper, so can information be written to a computer file.
- [x] **What is Folder?**
    - A folder, also called a directory, is a space used to store files, other folders, and shortcuts  on a computer. A good analogy is the manila folders seen in an office to store papers or reports.
    - **#A directory is a location for storing files on your computer.**
    - **The Purpose of the folder**
        - Folders help you keep your files organized and separate. 
        - If you had no folders on your computer, your documents, programs, and operating system files would all be located in the same place. 
        - Specific work, specific folder make easy to find out that file.
- **What is a filename extension(.exe .pdf .txt .go .php etc)?**
    - A filename extension, file extension or file type is an identifier specified as a suffix to the name of a computer file. A filename extension is typically delimited from the filename with a full stops.
    - **The Purpose of the filename extensions**

        - For example, a file with an extension of .jpg is a photo and a file extension of .exe tells you it's a program. 
- [x] **What is the package in GO?**
    - A package of collection of source files in the same directory. Packages are the most powerful part of the Go language. The purpose of a package is to design and maintain a large number of programs by grouping related features together into single units so that they can be easy to maintain and understand and independent of the other package programs. Like Package  “fmt” implements formatted I/O with functions analogous to C's printf and scanf.
    - **The Purpose of the Go packages**
        - Package means reusable {create one time use multiple times}.
        - It organizes code so that its easier to find code you want to reuse & maintenance.
