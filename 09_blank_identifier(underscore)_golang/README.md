# Blank Indentifier Underscore in Golang
- [x] **What is blank identifier?**
   - _(underscore) in Golang is known as the Blank Identifier. Identifiers are the user-defined name of the program components used for the identification purpose. Golang has a special feature to define and use the unused variable using Blank Identifier. Unused variables are those variables which are defined by the user throughout the program but he/she never make the use of these variables. These variables make the program almost unreadable. As you know, Golang is more concise and readable programming language so it doesn’t allow the programmer to define an unused variable if you do such, then the compiler will throw an error.
    The real use of Blank Identifier comes when a function returns multiple values, but we need only a few values and want to discard some values. Basically, it tells the compiler that this variable is not needed and ignored it without any error. It hides the variable’s values and makes the program readable. So whenever you will assign a value to Bank Identifier it becomes unusable.
